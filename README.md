# PART I - Algorithms

**Instruction** Explain how quantum computation works:
1. Initialize a quantum register with a state determined from a given boolean input.
2. Perform a sequence of quantum state transitions.
3. Measure the quantum state, which results in a boolean output.


# Real Quantum Bits

**Convention** We denote 
- the standard two-dimensional $\mathbf R$ vector space, which consists of column vectors with two rows and entries from $\mathbf R$, by $\RS 2$, 
- the standard inner product on this vector space by $\IP \cdot \cdot$, and 
- the standard basis vectors by $\Ket 0$ and $\Ket 1$. 

##### Instruction
Explain
- how vectors are expressed as linear combinations,
- how the inner product is defined,
- how coefficients of vectors can be determined by the inner product,
- how the norm is defined and which properties it has.

###### Def  {#asfdasfd}
A state of a quantum bit (qubit) is a vector of norm $1$ in $\RS 2$. The set of all such states is denoted $\RQS 1$.

**Rem** We have $$\RQS 1 = \{\alpha_0 \Ket 0 + \alpha_1 \Ket 1 \colon \alpha_0^2 + \alpha_1^2 = 1 \text{ and } \alpha_0, \alpha_1 \in \mathbf R\}\enspace.$$ For a given state $\Ket \varphi = \alpha_0 \Ket 0 + \alpha_1 \Ket 1$, the unique values $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ are called amplitudes of $\Ket 0$ and $\Ket 1$, respectively. We also set \begin{align}\Ket + & = \Oo 2 (\Ket 0 + \Ket 1) & \Ket - & = \Oo 2 (\Ket 0 -  \Ket 1) \enspace.\end{align}

**Activity** Visualize the set of states of a qubit.
